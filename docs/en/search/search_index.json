The development team has only tested on Windows, so we cannot guarantee that it will work, but the rendering process is implemented in the standard Niagara and Material nodes, so there is a good chance that it will work on non-Windows platforms. To create the package for non-Windows platforms, you need to add the platforms to line 22 of \"C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\UE_5.3\\Engine\\Plugins\\Marketplace\\ThreeDGaussians\\ThreeDGaussians.uplugin\". How do I reduce the package size? Set the Spherical Harmonics Degree to \"Degree 0\". Delete \"sh1\" to \"sh11\" texture assets in the content browser. You will get a reference relationship warning when deleting, but force the deletion. I placed the imported BP to a level, but nothing hoppens Make sure one or more of the EnbaledBlocks are set to True. Make sure that the real-time rendering of viewport is turned on. (Ctrl+R) Editor crashes when I placed the imported BP to a level Most likely there is not enough memory on the GPU. Please try the following Enable only one or a few of EnbaledBlocks Place BP on an empty level Rendering result is incorrect When Split by Morton Order , check while Play In Editor. The rendering order is sorted only during Play. When Split by the distance , the blocks are correctly rendered only when camera is placed in the block nearest to the origin. Rendering results do not match the official viewer Since our implementation is fundamentally different from the official implementation of the viewer, rendering results do not always match. One way to increase the rendering accuracy is to open \"Engine > Plugins > 3D Gaussians Content > Niagara > NMS_SetConicCov2d\" in the content browser and set the \"B\" value of the \"Multiply\" node at the bottom right of the graph, which is commented \"up to N sigma\", to a large value such as 10. This will increase the size of the sprite on which gaussians are rendered and ensure that the edges of the gaussians are rendered correctly. Official Implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting is not available for commercial use, how about this plugin? This plugin is implemented from scratch using Niagara and Material's node-based programming without any source code from the official implementation. (It does not even contain CUDA or HLSL source code). Therefore, this plugin itself is available for commercial use just like any other product in the Unreal Engine Marketplace. However, the user is responsible for the origin of the data created by the user. Data created in a manner forbidden for commercial use cannot be used for commercial purposes. Note that in addition to the official implementation, there is an MIT-licensed unofficial implementation but it is not directly supported by this plugin. Is 3D Gaussian Splatting a family of photogrammetry? No, the underlying mechanisms are very different. Is 3D Gaussian Splatting a family of NeRF? No, the underlying mechanisms are very different. Is 3D Gaussian Splatting a family of Differentiable Rendering? Yes.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-i-make-packages-for-platforms-other-than-windows","text":"The development team has only tested on Windows, so we cannot guarantee that it will work, but the rendering process is implemented in the standard Niagara and Material nodes, so there is a good chance that it will work on non-Windows platforms.

Because there is a limit to the number of particles in a Niagara system, this plugin imports 3D Gaussian Splatting data into multiple blocks and assign a Niagara system for each block. This allows for large data to be rendered, but it does cause a problem: if you look carefully, you can see the seams between the blocks. For this reason, the block split rules can be edited according to the intended use. The data is re-split by changing the rules in the following procedure and importing the data again. Specify block size In this plugin, the 3D Gaussian Splatting data after splitting is stored in square textures. The maximum value of the texture's sides can be set by specifying the console variable like ThreeDGaussians.MaxTextureWidth 1264 . The square of this value is the maximum number of particles each block can hold. The default value is 1024. This method can be re-enabled by specifying the following in the console variable: ThreeDGaussians.DoSplitBy3dMortonOrder 1 The max number of particles in Niagara The maximum number of particles Niagara can handle is 2,000,000. (as of UE5.1). However, although the detailed conditions are unknown, sometimes a warning message appears with a smaller value (e.g., 1,597,823 particles). Therefore, the default split size is set to 1024*1024=1,048,576. Select split mode Split by Morton Order This method is enabled by default. Split data into two blocks by the position of Z-axis \u2192 For each split block, split data into two blocks by the position of Y-axis. \u2192 For each split block, split data into two blocks by the position of X-axis. \u2192 For each split block, split data into two blocks by the position of Z-axis. \u2192 ... (Loop until the size of the block becomes smaller then the max size specified above.) This method has the advantage that it is easy to sort the depth of each block viewed from the camera. On the other hand, it has the disadvantage that it is difficult to predict where the seams between the blocks will appear. Runtime depth-sort for each block A binary tree is used to the depth-sort of each block. This binary tree is constructed during the splitting and stored in TArray<FThreeDGaussiansTree> tree . This tree is an element of FThreeDGaussians which is passed from C++ importer to a subclass of BP_3D_Gaussians_Base which is used at runtime. Depth-sort by the binary tree is implemented in the Tick event of BP_3D_Gaussians_Base . Split by the distance Make a block from the first N data closest to the origin \u2192 Make a block from the next N data closest to the origin \u2192 ... (Loop until all data are grouped) This method has the advantage that seams between the blocks do not appear near the origin. However, this method has the disadvantage that although it can draw correctly when viewed from the block closest to the origin, it cannot draw correctly when viewed from the block outside of it. (This is because the drawing order of translucency can only be specified on a block-by-block basis.) Therefore, use this method for the scenes where the user moves only within the block closest to the origin. This method can be enabled by specifying the following two in the console variable: ThreeDGaussians.DoSplitBy3dMortonOrder 0 ThreeDGaussians.DoSplitByDistance 1 Tips Keep data as small as possible You can reduce the number of splits by keeping the data small in the first place. You can reduce the data size in exchange for image quality by specifying like --densification_interval 500 in the options of `train.py`` of 3D Gaussian Splatting.
